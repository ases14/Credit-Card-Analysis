## Key Features of the Dashboard  

### 1. Total Revenue and Income Analysis  
The dashboard showcases overall revenue, interest earned, and total income from different customer segments.  
- **Key Insights**: Revenue is highest among businessmen and self-employed individuals.  

### 2. Customer Segmentation  
Analyzed revenue by:  
- **Customer Job Roles**: Businessmen contribute the most revenue.  
- **Age Groups**: Customers aged 40-60 drive a significant portion of transactions.  
- **Education Levels**: Graduates account for the highest revenue.  

### 3. Spending Patterns and Use Behavior  
Insights into how customers spend using their credit cards:  
- **Expenditure Types**: Bills, entertainment, and fuel are the top spending categories.  
- **Card Usage**: Swipe-based transactions dominate with 35M revenue.  

### 4. Acquisition Cost and Efficiency  
Calculated customer acquisition costs (CAC) for each card type, showing cost-to-revenue relationships:  
- **Key Insight**: Platinum cards have the lowest CAC, while blue cards generate the highest revenue but with a higher cost.
